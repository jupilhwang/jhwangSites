# kafka client - quotas, latency  

[https://aivarsk.com/2021/11/01/low-latency-kafka-producers/](https://aivarsk.com/2021/11/01/low-latency-kafka-producers/)  

What still makes me wonder is why `librdkafka` does not set `TCP_NODELAY` by default. Because they are doing something similar to Nagleâ€™s algorithm in the library code by using `linger.ms`/ `queue.buffering.max.ms` settings and buffering messages.

Long story short, to optimize producers for latency, you should set both:

- `socket.nagle.disable` = True
- `queue.buffering.max.ms` = 0

I think you should also set `socket.nagle.disable` for low latency consumers to deliver acknowledgments as soon as possible.


  

## librdkafka - Low latency

```
Low latency

When low latency messaging is required the "queue.buffering.max.ms" should be tuned to the maximum permitted producer-side latency. Setting queue.buffering.max.ms to 1 will make sure messages are sent as soon as possible. You could check out How to decrease message latency to find more details.

```

[https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/wiki/How-to-decrease-message-latency](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/wiki/How-to-decrease-message-latency)  

  

Also read the manual's chapter on [low latency](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/INTRODUCTION.md#low-latency).

There are two builtin end-to-end latencies in librdkafka:

- Producer batch latency - `queue.buffering.max.ms` (alias `linger.ms`) - how long the producer waits for more messages to be `.._produce()`d by the app before sending them off to the broker in one batch of messages.
- Consumer batch latency -`fetch.wait.max.ms` - how much time the consumer gives the broker to fill up `fetch.min.bytes` worth of messages before responding.

When trying to minimize end-to-end latency it is important to adjust both of these settings:

- producer: `queue.buffering.max.ms` - set to 0 for immediate transmission, or some other low reasonable value (e.g. 5 ms)
- consumer: `fetch.wait.max.ms` - set to your allowed maximum latency, e.g. 10 (ms).

Setting `fetch.wait.max.ms` too low (lower than the partition message rate) causes the occassional FetchRequest to return empty before any new messages were seen on the broker, this in turn kicks in the `fetch.error.backoff.ms` timer that waits that long before the next FetchRequest. So you might want to decrease `fetch.error.backoff.ms` too.

In librdkafka <=0.9.2, or on **Windows**, you'll also want to minimize `socket.blocking.max.ms` for both producer and consumer.

### custom quota for (user=user1, client-id=clientA)

```
bin/kafka-configs.sh  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter \
  --add-config 'producer_byte_rate=1024,consumer_byte_rate=2048,request_percentage=200' \
  --entity-type users --entity-name user1 --entity-type clients \
  --entity-name clientA

```

  

### default quota for user

```
bin/kafka-configs.sh  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter \
  --add-config 'producer_byte_rate=1024,consumer_byte_rate=2048,request_percentage=200' \
  --entity-type users --entity-default

```

  

### default quota for client

```
bin/kafka-configs.sh  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter \
  --add-config 'producer_byte_rate=1024,consumer_byte_rate=2048,request_percentage=200' \
  --entity-type clients --entity-default

```

  

  

```
bin/kafka-configs.sh  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe \
  --entity-type users --entity-type clients

Configs for user-principal 'user1', default client-id are producer_byte_rate=1024,consumer_byte_rate=2048,request_percentage=200
Configs for user-principal 'user1', client-id 'clientA' are producer_byte_rate=1024,consumer_byte_rate=2048,request_percentage=200
